As is widely known, the growth of Data in the present age of Information Technology is immense and overwhelming. The problem of storing such quantities of data is a major research ground for enthusiasts today and owing to their consistent efforts over the last decade, the solution of Cloud as a service was devised. Cloud storage enables users to store huge amounts of data remotely and without the ownership of any hardware units. Imagine how tedious and expensive it would have been if all firms today had to host their own storage units for data. It not only would have been a huge overhead expense, but also would have restricted the companyâ€™s data and computing flexibility.
